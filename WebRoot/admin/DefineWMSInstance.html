    <title>Define WMS Instance</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h4>
      This is an app to create a
      <i>WMS instance</i> settings file for RIMapperWMS.
    </h4>
    <p>
      RIMapperWMS can be installed as multiple WMS 'instances': Each instance
      will be created by installing a copy of the RIMapperWMS servlets as a web
      application in your servlet container. In most Java servlet containers,
      this would be a seperate folder in the
      <tt>webapps</tt> directory. In each webapp a
      <tt>wms_instance.xml</tt> file defines the DB connection this instance
      will use.

    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, when the demo from the download is installed in the TomCat
      directory
      <tt>webapps/RIMapper/</tt>, the
      <tt>wms_instance.xml</tt> in that directory will use PostGIS as its
      Spatial Feature Server. It will connect to a DB 'rimapper' (created by the
      load script included in the download), as user 'rimapper' with password
      'rimapper'. When changing or adding DB priviliges and/or users for the
      RIMapper DB, you'll have to change these settings accordingly!
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, we only include this small utility to generate the xml file <b> client-side</b>.
      We do <b>NOT</b> support writing the wms_instance.xml file server-side, for obvious security reasons. 
      Just generate the XML, then copy and paste into the actual wms_instance.xml file (in the WebRoot folder)...
